# Overview

RenderMix is a JRuby application that mixes audio, video and images,
along with visual effects, together into a single video.

It uses [jMonkeyEngine 3](http://jmonkeyengine.org/) as a framework
for visual effects.

RenderMix requires [librawmedia](https://github.com/rectalogic/librawmedia)

## WIP

RenderMix is currently a work in progress and incomplete.
Currently testing with jme3 r9561.
